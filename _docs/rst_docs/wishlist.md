# Extempore wishlist {#extempore-wishlist}

Building a new programming language, runtime and ecosystem is a
multifaceted job. Here are a few projects (some small, some not so
small) which would be really nice---if you think you'd like to
contribute, give us a shout out on the [mailing
list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com).

## Core {#core}

These projects involve hacking on the Extempore binary itself.

1.  upgrade to LLVM 5.0 & ORCJIT
2.  port Extempore to 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`)

## xtlang {#xtlang}

These projects (mostly) involve adding/improving libraries for doing
cool things in xtlang.

1.  add animation to the graphics pipeline
2.  a 2D/3D hardware-accelerated data visualisation library (e.g. a
    vega-lite for Extempore)
3.  add DirectX (or perhaps Vulkan) support

## Ecosystem {#ecosystem}

These projects are "ecosystem/tooling" projects.

1.  add xtlang support to highlight.js (shouldn't be *too* difficult,
    you can basically copy the parsing regexes from the Atom plugin)
2.  a SWIG (or similar) wrapper generator to automatically generate the
    xtlang `bind-lib` definitions
3.  improve the main Extempore website (<http://extempore.moso.com.au>),
    potentially rolling this docs website into the main site
4.  add an xtlang package manager (e.g. CPAN or cargo for Extempore)
5.  set up Jenkins (or CTest, or whatever) build & test servers for
    Windows, macOS and Linux to create nightly builds and run the test
    suite
6.  make the CMake build process aware of the xtlang ahead-of-time
    compilation process, so that `make aot` only re-aot-compiles an
    xtlang library if it has changed
