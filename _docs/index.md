title: Extempore documentation
permalink: /docs/
---

These docs are broadly grouped into **Overview**, **Reference** and **Guides**
sections. To navigate, use the sidebar on the left (or on top, if you're on
mobile).

The docs website has recently been redesigned with a view to making it easier
for others to contribute. It's just markdown, and every page has an *improve
this page* link at the bottom which takes you directly to the source `.md` file
on GitHub so that you can fix it up and submit a pull request.

## Getting help

Learning a new programming language is hard, so don't despair if you get
stuck and need help. The [mailing
list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com) and [google
group](https://groups.google.com/group/extemporelang) are good places to
start, or you could see if we're on the **\#extempore** IRC channel on
freenode.

For discussions about the docs themselves, there's a new **extempore-docs**
channel on the [livecode slack group](https://livecode.slack.com/) where you can
discuss issues/comments/suggestions for the docs. Contributing to the docs
[really is pretty easy]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/overview/contributing.md
%}#documentation), so don't be afraid to pipe up if you've got ideas.
